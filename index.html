<p id="rules">The main goal in the game of Blackjack is to reach 21 points. If you exceed this number, you lose. When you hit Blackjack, you will receive six times your remaining money. When you lose, you have to pay money according to your score. You can play as many times as you wish, provided that you have money. When you go broke, the game is over. You start the game by hitting the gamble button and picking two cards. After that, you can choose a random card if it is necessary. </p>
